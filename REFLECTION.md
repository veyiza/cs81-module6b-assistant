What made your assistant “personal” to you? 
It felt personal because I named it after someone and used real tasks I would usually do in my week.

What challenges did you face using this? 
Getting used to how this works inside each method was a little confusing.

Which method would you improve or expand? 
I’d improve completeTask() so you could finish a specific task instead of always the first one.
